# Simple Scalping Strategy Backtester

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

Passionate and results-driven trader with a keen interest in manual and algorithmic trading strategies. Seeking opportunities to leverage my expertise in developing and implementing a simple yet effective scalping strategy coded in Python. My focus is on creating a versatile trading strategy that can be easily optimized and adapted to meet my specific trading needs, whether executed manually or through automation. By utilizing the 5-minute timeframe, I aim to accelerate trading frequency and enhance the risk-reward ratio, all while harnessing Python's capabilities for strategy optimization and rigorous backtesting. 5 min timeframe. This strategy uses 2 EMA curves for trend detection, if the fast moving average is above the slow moving average we have uptrend and if the fast moving average is
below the slow moving average we have a downtrend. In uptrend we only consider long positions and in downtrend we only consider short positions. Then we use the bollinger band indicator edges for entry points. If we have a uptrend and price crosses the lower bollinger band we enter a long position. If he have a downtrend and price crosses the higher bollinger band we enter a short position. The idea is price will come back to the center of the bollinger band after crossing extreme values while trading in the same direction as the moving average trend. Stop loss is the ATR at the time of the trade. Used pandas,pandas ta, numpy, plotly libararies to code in juppyter notebook
